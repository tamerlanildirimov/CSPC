"""
PW2 Lab A -- Motion from tracking data.

Read noisy free-fall position measurements, then:
  - differentiate once  -> velocity
  - differentiate twice -> acceleration (should be ~ constant -g, but noisy!)
  - integrate the acceleration back up -> recover velocity and position

Complete the TODOs. Run:  python analysis.py

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import cumulative_trapezoid

# TODO 1: read freefall.csv into arrays t and y
#         (hint: np.loadtxt with a comma delimiter, skipping the header)

# TODO 2: compute velocity v = derivative of y w.r.t. t   (np.gradient)
#         and acceleration a = derivative of v w.r.t. t    (np.gradient again)
#         Print the mean acceleration. Is it close to -9.81? Is it noisy?

# TODO 3: integrate a back up to recover velocity and position
#         (hint: cumulative_trapezoid(a, t, initial=0) + v[0], then again)

# TODO 4: make a figure with 3 stacked panels: position, velocity, acceleration
#         vs time. Mark the true -9.81 line on the acceleration panel.
#         Save it as motion.png
